STARTERHACKS 2020

*Foodify*

We were inspired by the prompt of "Canadians often struggle to adopt behaviours that reduce their environmental footprint", from the the sustanibitly impact statement of the starterhacks website.

We noted that in our own lives how difficult it was to not only buy food to acheive health goals, yet also not overbuy and create food waste.

Diving further into this problem, we discovered that it was larger then we imagined.

If for the average person, they waste 1 pound of food per week. That equates to 48 pounds of CO2 emmisions (per year?). That is the same as driving 57 miles, which does not even include the environemental impact of the transportation of the food.

This is where Foodify comes into play.

Foodify, the new innovative platform assists you in not only eliminating your food waste but also helps you plan what to buy and how much to buy to aid in healthy eating.
