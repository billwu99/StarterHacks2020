# STARTERHACKS 2020

## Foodify Inspiration

 - We were inspired by the prompt of *"Canadians often struggle to adopt behaviours that reduce their environmental footprint"*, from the the sustanibitly impact statement of the starterhacks website.

 - We noted that in our own lives how difficult it was to not only buy food to acheive health goals, yet also not overbuy and create food waste.

 - Diving further into this problem, we discovered that it was larger then we imagined.

 - If for the average person, they waste 1 pound of food per week. That equates to 48 pounds of CO2 emmisions per year. That is the same as driving 57 miles, which does not even include the environemental impact of the transportation of the food.

 - This is where Foodify comes into play.

 - *Foodify*, the new innovative platform assists you in not only eliminating your food waste but also helps you plan what to buy and how much to buy to aid in healthy eating.

## How it Works

 - Once you finish scrolling through the intial landing page, you can 'Get Started' by simply cliking on the button.

 - This bring you to the information form, a very short form to fill in to get to know a bit more about yourself and your weight goals.

 - Soon after the completion of the form, you can seach for your favourite foods that you want to eat for the next week.

 - Immediately after, our algorithm composes a shopping list catered to you for the next week. This even includes an in depth breakdown of the macro nutriets and caloric intake of the grocery list.
